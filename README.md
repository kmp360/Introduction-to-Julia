# Introduction-to-Julia

The Julia course (https://www.ualg.pt/en/curso/2941) will provide basic knowledge and programming skills in a modern computer programming language designed for high-performance scientific computing (https://julialang.org/).

Who is the course for? Anyone who is motivated to learn a modern programming language from scratch. No previous programming experience is necessary. 

What will you learn? You will learn the complete Julia Core and how to program in a modern integrated development environment VS Code (https://www.julia-vscode.org/).

You will learn how to use Julia to solve simple programming problems and to write clear, well-structured, and well-commented code, debugging, and code development strategies.

You will learn how to use the Julia package manager and the Julia documentation and the Julia Community Channels to troubleshoot problems.

You will also develop some familiarity with importing data and the use of external packages like CSV.jl, DataFrames.jl, Statistics.jl and Plots.jl at a level where you can start to develop your own project code independently; familiarize yourself with Jupyter Notebooks (for learning and teaching purposes).

What do I need? A modern laptop, a strong motivation to learn, and sufficient English proficiency to use the Julia documentation and the course material.

When? The course will run through out September 2022 from the 1st of September each day 16:00 – 18:00.

The course is closely based on the text Lauwens & Downey "Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" which you can find here: https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html
For those who have registered and wants a course grading, the grading is either pass (aprovado) or fail (faltou).
To pass the course the participant should attempt to solve one, mostly simple but relevant, code problem per lecture as indicated by the lecturer.
We will briefly discuss solutions to the problem at the beginning of the next lecture.
Please try to install Julia and VS Code on your laptop before the first lecture according to the following:
1. Install Julia 1.8.0 for your platform: https://julialang.org/downloads/
2. Install VS Code for your platform: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
At the end of this step, you should be able to start VS Code. If it does not work, please let me know. For more information see:
