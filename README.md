# Introduction-to-Julia

The Julia course will provide basic knowledge and programming skills in a modern computer programming language designed for high-performance scientific computing (https://julialang.org/).

The course is based on the text by Lauwens & Downey "Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" which you can find at https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html

Who is the course for? Anyone who is motivated to learn a modern programming language from scratch. No previous programming experience is necessary. 

What will you learn? You will learn Julia Core and how to program in a modern integrated development environment Visual Studio (VS) Code. You will also lear to work with Jupyter Notebooks.

You will learn how to use Julia to solve simple programming problems and to write clear, well-structured and well-commented code, debugging, and code development strategies.

You will learn how to use the Julia package manager and how to use the Julia documentation and the Julia Community to troubleshoot problems.

You will also develop some familiarity with importing data and the use of external packages like CSV.jl, DataFrames.jl, Statistics.jl and Plots.jl at a level where you can start to develop your own project code independently. 

What do you need? A modern laptop, a strong motivation to learn, and sufficient English proficiency to use the Julia documentation and the course material.

To pass the course the participant should attempt to solve one, mostly simple but relevant, code problem per lecture as indicated by the lecturer. We will briefly discuss solutions to the problem at the beginning of the next lecture.

To install Julia and VS Code on your laptop:

1. Install the current stable release of Julia at https://julialang.org/downloads/

2. Install VS Code at https://code.visualstudio.com/download

3. Start VS code and View > Extensions (Ctrl + Shift + X)

4. Search for and install the extensions: Julia Language Support and Jupyter notebook support
