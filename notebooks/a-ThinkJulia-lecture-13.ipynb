Julia announces this by echoing **dictionary_difference (generic function with 2 methods)**.\n",

    "If you choose words from the book at random, you can get a sense of the vocabulary, but you probably will not get a sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tthis the small regard harriet which knightley's it most things\n",
    "\n",
    "A series of random words seldom makes sense because there is no relationship between successive words. For example, in a real sentence you would expect an article like “the” to be followed by an adjective or a noun, and probably not a verb or adverb.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to measure these kinds of relationships is Markov analysis, which characterizes, for a given sequence of words, the probability of the words that might come next. For example, the song Eric, the Half a Bee (by Monty Python) begins:\n",

    "\tHalf a bee, philosophically,\n",

Given this mapping, you can generate a random text by starting with any prefix and choosing at random from the possible suffixes. Next, you can combine the end of the prefix and the new suffix to form the next prefix, and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you start with the prefix “Half a”, then the next word has to be “bee”, because the prefix only appears once in the text. The next prefix is “a bee”, so the next suffix might be “philosophically”, “be” or “due”. In this example the length of the prefix is always two, but you can do Markov analysis with any prefix length."

    "### Data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In your solution to the previous exercises, you had to choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) How to represent the prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) How to represent the collection of possible suffixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) How to represent the mapping from each prefix to the collection of possible suffixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last one is easy: a dictionary is the obvious choice for a mapping from keys to corresponding values. For the prefixes, the most obvious options are string, array of strings, or tuple of strings. For the suffixes, one option is an array; another is a histogram (dictionary).\n",
    "\n",
    "How should you choose? \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to think about the operations you will need to implement for each data structure. For the prefixes, we need to be able to remove words from the beginning and add to the end. For example, if the current prefix is “Half a”, and the next word is “bee”, you need to be able to form the next prefix, “a bee”. Your first choice might be an array, since it is easy to add and remove elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the collection of suffixes, the operations we need to perform include adding a new suffix (or increasing the frequency of an existing one), and choosing a random suffix. \n",
    "Adding a new suffix is equally easy for the array implementation or the histogram. Choosing a random element from an array is easy; choosing from a histogram is harder to do efficiently (see Exercise 13-7).\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been talking mostly about ease of implementation, but there are other factors to consider in choosing data structures. One is run time. Sometimes there is a theoretical reason to expect one data structure to be faster than other; for example, the in operator is faster for dictionaries than for arrays, at least when the number of elements is large. But often you do not know ahead of time which implementation will be faster. One option is to implement both of them and see which is better. This approach is called **benchmarking**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A practical alternative is to choose the data structure that is easiest to implement, and then see if it is fast enough for the intended application. If so, there is no need to go on. If not, there are tools, like the **Profile module**, that can identify the places in a program that take the most time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other factor to consider is storage space. For example, using a histogram for the collection of suffixes might take less space because you only have to store each word once, no matter how many times it appears in the text. In some cases, saving space can also make your program run faster, and in the extreme, your program might not run at all if you run out of memory. But for many applications, space is a secondary consideration after run time.\n",

    "### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a hard bug, there are five things to try:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says what you meant to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment by making changes and running different versions. Often if you display the right thing at the right place in the program, the problem becomes obvious, but sometimes you have to build scaffolding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ruminating\n",
    "\n",
    "Take some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime, or semantic? \n",
    "\n",
    "What information can you get from the error messages, or from the output of the program? What kind of error could cause the problem you are seeing? What did you change last, before the problem appeared?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rubberducking\n",
    "\n",
    "If you explain the problem to someone else, you sometimes find the answer before you finish asking the question. Often you do not need the other person; you could just talk to a rubber duck. And that is the origin of the well-known strategy called rubber duck debugging https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retreating\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point, the best thing to do is back off, undoing recent changes, until you get back to a program that works and that you understand. Then you can start rebuilding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities and forget the others. Each activity comes with its own failure mode. For example, reading your code might help if the problem is a typographical error, but not if the problem is a conceptual misunderstanding. If you do not understand what your program does, you can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in your head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests. But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your code, you might fall into a pattern I call “random walk programming”, which is the process of making random changes until the program does the right thing. Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental science. You should have at least one hypothesis about what the problem is. If there are two or more possibilities, try to think of a test that would eliminate one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many errors, or if the code you are trying to fix is too big and complicated. Sometimes the best option is to retreat, simplifying the program until you get to something that works and that you understand. Beginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they cannot stand to delete a line of code. If it makes you feel better, copy your program into another file before you start stripping it down. Then you can copy the pieces back one at a time.\n",
