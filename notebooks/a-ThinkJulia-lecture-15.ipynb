    "At this point you know how to use functions to organize code and built-in types to organize data. The next step is to learn how to build your own types or **data structures to organize both code and data**. This is a big topic and it will take a few chapters to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composite Types\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used many of Julia’s built-in types; now we are going to define a new type. As an example, we will create a type called Point that represents a point in two-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating the coordinates. For example, (0,0) represents the origin, and (x,y) represents the point x units to the right and y units up from the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways we might represent points in Julia:\n",
    "- We could store the coordinates separately in two variables, x and y.\n",
    "- We could store the coordinates as elements in an array or tuple.\n",
    "- We could create a new type to represent points as objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new type is more complicated than the other options, but it has advantages that will be apparent soon. A programmer-defined composite type is also called a **`struct`**. The struct definition for a point looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "    struct Point\n",
    "        x\n",
    "        y\n",
    "    end\n",
    "```\n",
    "The header indicates that the new struct is called Point. The body defines the attributes or **`fields` of the struct**. The Point struct has two fields: x and y. A struct is like a factory for creating objects. To create a point, you call Point as if it were a function having as arguments the values of the fields. When Point is used as a function, it is called a **`constructor`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "    julia> p = Point(3.0, 4.0)\n",
    "    Point(3.0, 4.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The return value is a reference to a Point object** which is assigned to `p`. Creating a new object is called **`instantiation`**, and the **object is an instance of the type**. When you print an instance, Julia tells you what type it belongs to and what the values of the atributes are. Every object is an instance of some type."
