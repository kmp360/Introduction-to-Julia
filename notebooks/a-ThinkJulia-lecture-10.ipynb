    "\n",
    "- If you are used to writing string code like this: `new_word = strip(word)`, it is tempting to write array code like this: `t2 = sort!(t1)`. Because sort! returns the modified original array, `t2` is an alias of `t1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before using array functions and operators, read the documentation and test them in interactive mode or in VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn an idiom and stick with it. Part of the challenge with arrays is that there are many ways of doing things. For example, to remove an element from an array, you can use `pop!`, `popfirst!`, `delete_at`, or even a `slice assignment`. To add an element, you can use `push!`, `pushfirst!`, `insert!` or `vcat`. Assuming that t is an array and x is an array element, these are correct:\n",

    "\tvcat(t, [x])               # WRONG!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make copies to avoid aliasing.** If you want to use a function like `sort!` that modifies the argument, but you need to keep the original array as well, you can make a copy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "    julia> t = [3, 1, 2];\n",
    "\n",
    "    julia> t2 = t[:];     # t2 = copy(t)\n",
