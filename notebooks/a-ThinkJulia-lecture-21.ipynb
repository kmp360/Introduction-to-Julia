    "When you are debugging, you should distinguish among different kinds of errors in order to track them down more quickly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syntax errors are discovered by the interpreter when it is translating the source code into byte code. They indicate that there is something wrong with the structure of the program. Example: Omitting the end keyword at the end of a function block generates the somewhat redundant message ERROR: LoadError: syntax: incomplete: function requires end.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Runtime errors are produced by the interpreter if something goes wrong while the program is running. Most runtime error messages include information about where the error occurred and what functions were executing. Example: An infinite recursion eventually causes the runtime error ERROR: StackOverflowError.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semantic errors are problems with a program that runs without producing error messages but doesn’t do the right thing. Example: An expression may not be evaluated in the order you expect, yielding an incorrect result.\n",

    "### Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are usually easy to fix once you figure out what they are. Unfortunately, the error messages are often not helpful. The most common messages are ERROR: LoadError: syntax: incomplete: premature end of input and ERROR: LoadError: syntax: unexpected \"=\", neither of which is very informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the message does tell you where in the program the problem occurred. **Actually, it tells you where Julia noticed a problem, which is not necessarily where the error is.** Sometimes the error is prior to the location of the error message, often on the preceding line.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are building the program incrementally, you should have a good idea about where the error is. It will be in the last line you added. If you are copying code from a book, start by comparing your code to the book’s code very carefully. Check every character. At the same time, remember that the book might be wrong, so if you see something that looks like a syntax error, it might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ways to avoid the most common syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you are not using a Julia keyword for a variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check that you have the end keyword at the end of every compound statement, including for, while, if, and function blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure that any strings in the code have matching quotation marks. Make sure that all quotation marks are “straight quotes”, not “curly quotes”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have multiline strings with triple quotes , make sure you have terminated the string properly. An unterminated string may cause an invalid token error at the end of your program, or it may treat the following part of the program as a string until it comes to the next string. In the second case, it might not produce an error message at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "- An unclosed opening operator—(, {, or [—makes Julia continue with the next line as part of the current statement. Generally, an error occurs almost immediately in the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check for the classic = instead of == inside a conditional.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have non-ASCII characters in the code (including strings and comments), that might cause a problem, although Julia usually handles non-ASCII characters. Be careful if you paste in text from a web page or other source.\n",
    "\n",

    "- You changed the name of the file, but you are still running the old name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Something in your development environment is configured incorrectly.\n",

    "\n",
    "- If you are using using to import a module, remember that you have to restart the REPL when you modify the code in the module. If you import the module again, it does not do anything.\n",

    "\n",
    "### My program hangs\n",
    "\n",
    "If a program stops and seems to be doing nothing, it is “hanging”. Often that means that it is caught in an infinite loop or infinite recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If there is a particular loop that you suspect is the problem, add a print statement immediately before the loop that says “entering the loop” and another immediately after that says “exiting the loop”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the program. If you get the first message and not the second, you have an infinite loop. Go to Infinite Loop below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most of the time, an infinite recursion will cause the program to run for a while and then produce a ERROR: LoadError: StackOverflowError error. If that happens, go to Infinite Recursion below.\n",

    "- If you are not getting this error but you suspect there is a problem with a recursive method or function, you can still use the techniques in Infinite Recursion.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Infinite Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think you have an infinite loop and you think you know what loop is causing the problem, add a print statement at the end of the loop that prints the values of the variables in the condition and the value of the condition.\n",

    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",

    "      # do something to y\n",

    "      @debug \"condition\" x > 0 && y < 0\n",
    "  end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you run the program in debug mode, you will see the value of the variables and the condition for each time through the loop. The last time through the loop, the condition should be false. If the loop keeps going, you will be able to see the values of x and y, and you might figure out why they are not being updated correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infinite Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, infinite recursion causes the program to run for a while and then produce a ERROR: LoadError: StackOverflowError error.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If there is a base case but the program does not seem to be reaching it, add a print statement at the beginning of the function that prints the parameters. Now when you run the program, you will see a few lines of output every time the function is invoked, and you will see the parameter values. If the parameters are not moving toward the base case, you will get some ideas about why not.\n",
