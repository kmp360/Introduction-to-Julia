    "    function addtime(t1, t2)\n",
    "        MyTime(t1.hour + t2.hour, t1.minute + t2.minute, t1.second + t2.second)\n",
    "    end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function creates a new MyTime object, initializes its fields, and returns a reference to the new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is sometimes called a pure function because it does not modify any of the objects passed to it as arguments and it has no effect, like displaying a value or getting user input, other than returning a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this function, we will create two MyTime objects: `start` contains the start time of a movie, and `duration` contains the run time of the movie, which is one hour 35 minutes; `addtime` figures out when the movie will be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The result, 10:80:00 might not be what you were hoping for. The problem is that this function does not deal with cases where the number of seconds or minutes adds up to more than sixty. \n",
    "\n",
    "When that happens, we have to **`carry`** the extra seconds into the minute column or the extra minutes into the hour column. \n",

    "\n",
    "The first line performs the basic operation; the remainder deals with the special cases we saw before. Is this function correct? What happens if seconds is much greater than 60? In that case, it is not enough to carry once; we have to keep doing it until time.second is less than sixty. One solution is to replace the if statements with while statements. That would make the function correct, but not very efficient."

    "The development plan demonstrated, **prototype and patch**: For each function, a prototype was first written that performed the basic calculation and then tested, patching errors along the way.\n",

    "This approach can be effective, especially if you do not yet have a deep understanding of the problem but are rather discovering by exploration. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

The second attribute is the \"ones column\", the minute attribute is the \"sixties column\", and the hour attribute is the \"thirty-six hundreds column\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When we wrote addtime and increment!, we were effectively doing addition in base 60, which is why we had to carry from one column to the next. This observation suggests another approach to the whole problem—we can convert MyTime objects to integers and take advantage of the fact that the computer knows how to do integer arithmetic. Here is a function that converts mytimes to integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",

    "        seconds = minutes * 60 + time.second\n",
    "    end\n",
    "```\n",
    "And here is a function that converts an integer to a MyTime (recall that `divrem` divides the first argument by the second and returns the quotient and remainder as a tuple):\n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "    function inttotime(seconds)\n",
    "        (minutes, second) = divrem(seconds, 60)\n",
    "        hour, minute = divrem(minutes, 60)\n",
    "        MyTime(hour, minute, second)\n",
    "    end\n",
    "```\n",
    "You might have to think a bit, and run some tests, to convince yourself that these functions are correct. One way to test them is to check that timetoint(inttotime(x)) == x for many values of x. This is an example of a **`consistency check`**.\n",
    "\n",

    "    function addtime(t1, t2)\n",

    "\n",
