    "In Julia you have the ability to write code that can operate on different types. This is called **generic programming**. In this chapter we will discuss the use of type declarations in Julia and introduce methods which are ways to implement different behavior for a function depending on the types of its arguments. This is called **multiple dispatch**.\n",
